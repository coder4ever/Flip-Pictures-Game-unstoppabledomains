# Guessing NFT Game

## About

Flip Pictures Game is a decentralized game where players can play for a chance to win NFTs. The features include easy-to-operate controls, 3 levels of difficulty, entertaining animations, and sounds.


Users will be able to enter his/her name and select an avatar for her profile. As well as to pick a level of difficulty for the game. This allows in the future to gather data gathering with IPFS, analysis and learning pathway suggestions to develop more features within the app.

## How does it work?

t's a simple game, just go to the app and:

1. Flip two cards each turn to find the matching pairs.

2. You win when all the pairs have been found.

3. The fewer turns you use to win, the higher your score.

## Future

In the future we would like to implement: Support player challenge friends and other players.
